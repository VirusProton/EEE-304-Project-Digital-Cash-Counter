# EEE-304-Project-Digital-Cash-Counter
This was a project required for course work of EEE-304 .

We implemented a digital cash counter using logic gates and sequential circuits which can register product price of a given product form product code and serve in any departmental store as cash counter.

### Design procedure
First we designed our system and simulated the whole system using circuit simulator **Proteus** then we implemented it in hardware according to our simulation. <br>
All the simulation files will be found in [this folder](./Proteus_simulation_files) and video demonstration will be found in [this folder](./Project%20Demonstration%20videos)
